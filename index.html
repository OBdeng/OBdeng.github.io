  <h1>What is a badminton?</h1>
  <p>Badminton, also known as shuttlecock, is a sport played with a light racquet and a bird-shaped shuttlecock. Players use their feet to strike the bird toward a target area. The game of badmvin is played all around the world and is especially popular in India, China, and South Korea. It's also quite challenging to play by hand. In fact, some variants of the game are even played this way. Many schools, clubs and associations have been set up for players of all ages and abilities. Since the game is so popular, there have been many variations created to make it more fun.</p>
<p>The object of badminton is for the bird to return to the player's hand without touching the ground. To do this, players must hit the bird toward the center of the court at a high speed. The bird must then bounce off a string attached to the bottom of the racket before returning back to the player's hand. The game of badminton is usually played outdoors on a large area of grass or cemented court surfaces. A designated area is needed because it's dangerous to play with a bird while indoors. Rackets vary in size depending on the weight and age of the player. A light racket is used for children under eight years old while an adult's one is used for players ages 8 and up. A shuttlecock made of feathers should be between 1 and 2 pounds in weight.</p>
